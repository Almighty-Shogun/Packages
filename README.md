# Node Packages
A collection of Node / Bun packages I use in (personal) projects.

> [!NOTE]
> All these packages are designed to work for my own (personal) projects. Because of this reason I will not accept PR's with that add or change features. I will only accept bug fixes.

## ℹ️ Package versioning
This repository contains multiple **Node** / **Bun** packages maintained together as a single workspace.

Versioning is unified. Whenever any package in this repository receives a version update, the new version is applied consistently across all packages.
Individual packages do not follow independent versioning, all packages share the same release version to ensure compatibility and simplify dependency management.
